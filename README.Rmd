## Overview

This **R package** implements a multivariate beta distribution and allows to construct credible regions for multiple proportions.

**NOTE: This package is no longer maintained!**


---

## Installation

The package can be downloaded and installed in R by running 

```{r install, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/maxwestphal/SIMPle")
```


---

## Details

The package implements methods from the paper

[*Westphal, Max. "Simultaneous Inference for Multiple Proportions: A Multivariate Beta-Binomial Model." arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.00098 (2019).*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00098)

It is primarily intended for reproduction of the numerical experiments described at [https://github.com/maxwestphal/SEPM.PUB](https://github.com/maxwestphal/SEPM.PUB).
