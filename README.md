# SIMPle: Simultaneous Inference for Multiple Proportions 

This **R package** implements a multivariate beta distribution and allows to construct multivariate credible regions.

## Description

The package implements methods from the paper

[*Westphal, Max. "Simultaneous Inference for Multiple Proportions: A Multivariate Beta-Binomial Model." arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.00098 (2019).*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00098)

Note that this is a roughly tested **DEVELOPMENT VERSION**. 

## Installation

The package can be downloaded and installed in R by running
